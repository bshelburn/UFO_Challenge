# UFO_Challenge
---
## Overview
The purpose of this exercise was to create a dynamic webpage with a table including mutliple search criteria for Dana and her data set of UFO activity. The initial webpage only included a date filter with an executable button.   To add further functionality the filter button was removed and we added filters for city, state, country, and shape.   Results mimic any and all filters applied to the dataset and return the updated results when "return" is hit.

## Results
### How to perform a search
Step 1: Execute the index.html file and you will arrive at the webpage with filters reading blank.

Step 2: Enter any desired search criteria such as date, city, state, country, or shape of UFO. I enetered the Date of 1/1/2010, State of CA, and City of El Cajon and results have now been fine tuned to only include those metrics.

Step 3: To further focus my results I enetered the additional filter of Triangle in the Shape filter.

## Summary
One drawback of the designed webpage is the search functioinality.  If you mispell or dont spell out completely your desired filter criteria your results will show blank. (Example Below)

Two recommendations for further development would be to add a fuzzzy search capability or spellcheck option for fields that must remain free text fields.   In addition to this I would also sugguest list dropdowns for categories for those filters without too many selections such as the Shape filter.   Also, despite an example of date format in the filter mistakess could still be made.   A pop out calendar where you can select the Year, Month, and date would help to avoid any issues.
